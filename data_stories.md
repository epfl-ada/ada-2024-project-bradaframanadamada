    <p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify">
        An actor, in addition to their main profession, could have engaged in many other types of occupations 
        throughout their career. These complementary occupations can provide an interesting perspective on the 
        actor's skills. Comparing the occupations an actor has pursued with the different personas they have performed 
        along his career can offer an overview of the skills and qualities required to act a given persona.<br><br>
        Below, you can see a bar chart highlighting the distribution of the top 20 most common occupations across 
        the 12 personas defined earlier in our analysis. You can use the picker located in the top-right corner of the 
        graph to select the persona for which you want to display the top 20 most common actor occupations associated 
        with it. For this visualization, we exclude actor's occupations "actor", "film actor" and "television actor", as 
        they are very closed to the core profession of acting.

    <b>stage actor</b> as the most frequent in their respective distributions, appearing between 600 and 1,400 times
